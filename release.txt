-- Switch to export C style API (e.g. slInit instead of sl::init and so on).  This will require changing any calls to these methods in existing integrations to the new naming convention.
-- Renamed some buffer types to be more technique agnostic (e.g. eBufferTypeTAAUInputColor and eBufferTypeTAAUOutputColor have been renamed to eBufferTypeScalingInputColor and eBufferTypeScalingOutputColor, respectively).
-- The parameters for the Resource Allocation and Release callbacks have been changed to require a device pointer.  Existing integrations utilizing these callbacks will need to be modified to work with the new signatures.
-- NRD updated to v3.1
-- Tags and features have been decoupled from the interposer and common plugin (new plugins and new tags can be added without having to recompile interposer or common plugin)
-- Feature constants have been split into individual header files to simplify adding new features and modifying existing ones.
-- Added slSetFeatureEnabled() method to allow control over if supported feature is enabled or not.
-- Shaders are provided pre-compiled.  If you need to compile HLSL shaders for your own plugin, you will need to place slang in the .\external\slang_internal folder and xxd in the .\tools folder.  Then any *.hlsl files in the .\shaders folder will be compiled at build time.
-- Bug Fix: CreateD3D12Device now handles null device correctly
-- Bug Fix: Dynamic resize and subRects now work in DLSS plugin
-- Known Issue: Benign "error" message that gitVersion.h cannot be found upon first build
